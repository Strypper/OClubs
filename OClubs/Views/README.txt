#Performance boost 60%
I have spent crazy amount of time to minimize unnecessary XAML elements 
please check deeper insider child folders so you could see the change


* MainFrame
* Departmant Tab
* About Tab


# Things to remember
* Don't use Acrylic on the NavBar
* Only use maximum 2 scrollviewer


# Existing Problems
App still lag and choppy a lot because of Gridview, still under investigation for that
